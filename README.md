# Nestor Velasco

## About Me
Hey there! I'm Nestor Velasco, an enthusiastic iOS Developer with a knack for crafting user-centric applications. With a Computer Science degree from The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, I'm dedicated to enhancing user experiences through my coding prowess.

## Experience
As an iOS Developer at La Nueva Tortiller√≠a, I've led the creation and deployment of two full-stack iOS apps that greatly improved user experiences and operational efficiency. My strengths lie in seamless collaboration across teams, optimizing algorithms for efficiency, and integrating third-party libraries.

## Projects
- **Inventory Revolution:** I built an intuitive inventory management app that harnessed real-time data and reduced processing time by 25%. The app includes features like a barcode scanner to minimize errors and Swift/Objective-C magic for seamless synchronization.
- **Tailored Solutions:** I led the development of a customized inventory app for Tortilleria La Nueva M, slashing stock discrepancies by 15% and streamlining workflow with Epson printer integration.
- **NV 8 Week Workout:** My brainchild, an 8-week fitness app, empowers users with dynamic tracking and real-time progress updates. Swift, Objective-C, and CoreData came together to create a user-friendly health companion.

## Skills
My toolkit includes Swift, SwiftUI, Objective-C, C++, Python, SQL, React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, along with proficiency in Git, GitHub, XCode, Figma, Visual Studio, and CloudKit.
